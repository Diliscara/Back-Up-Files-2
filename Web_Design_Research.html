<h1>What Web Design is</h1>
<p>A simple explanation of Website Design is the act of designing and creating websites. It is considered to be a form of art.</p>
<p>During the early 1990's, after the introduction of the World Wide Web, there were literally just a handful of websites online. They then grew in number rapidly during the end of the 20th century. There are now millions of websites today.</p>
<p>I have gathered the information about Website Design from this website <a href="http://www.theartcareerproject.com/website-design-a-modern-art-form/105/" target="_blank">www.theartcareerproject.com</a></p>
