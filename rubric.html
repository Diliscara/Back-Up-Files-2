I've been into computers since I entered Highschool. My only reason for doing it is simply because it's challenging and in order for me to get far
in this type of career I need to dedicate myself 100% into it. Which, admittedly, is something I haven't been able to do ever.
</p>

Since coming to Tri-Tech I've learned a lot to say the least. I knew a little bit about Java, HTML, CSS, PHP, and Javascript, enough to make a working website, before coming here.
After this year I know how to fully use both Java, JS, HTML, and CSS. I also know how to use Linux, Debian and PMA. I also learned about how Networks work and Binary code. In short,
I learned a LOT within a year.

Oh god, the only thing that wasn't challenging was HTML and CSS, those were almost TOO easy, but everything else? It felt like I was mountain climbing.
The biggest challenge in all honesty was installing Linux, not because it was confusing, but because it was a jerk and it took me 3 hours just to make it work on my computer.
Everything else seems to be more of a memory thing and I am bad at remembering some things.
My most successful thing is my localhost and google site, I know that when compared to a couple others that were in my class, my localhost isn't that great.
But I have absolutely no copied coding in it, I did get help from w3schools and Mr. Coleman, but I didn't go to his github and copied/pasted anything, same with everyone else who let me look at their code.
</p>
<p>
Personally, I'm just satisfied that I actually devoted myself to this class. Before this year, the most I could devote myself to were video games.
