	<p>Like a badass? I feel like you might be overexagerating a bit.</p>
	<p>Oh well, I mean, you are who you want to be. If that means you are a badass warrior with power unrivaled by all, then...you're not!</p>
	<p>You see, in order for this to be more amusing (mostly for me), you need to be a weak little warrior who has nothing!</p>
	<p>I'm only kidding, now time to get serious (scary thought no?) time to describe to you what you look like.</p>
	<pre>Your name is Kakakora Nakimi, daughter of War General Elavenia Nakimi and Commander Elvaester Nakimi. Since birth your job was to protect the Elven princess, but more about that later for now we'll ignore her existence as she has no significance in your story.
	Since the young age of 5, you had a sword in your hands and were trained every day in all forms of combat. When you turned 17, your mother and father hired the Queen's personal mage to come and teach you the ways of magic.
	You fucked that up. After finding out that the most you can do regarding magic was make a Dandylion do a little dance, the mage gave up and said you were useless without more advanced magical abilities. You did not take that too well.
	Most would believe that after being declared as a "Magically Crippled" Elf you and your parents would be devasted. Luckily for you, I don't like parents like that soooooooo they didn't give a SHIT about that!
	You did though, but not in the bad way. Instead you forced yourself to train twice as hard with your physical gifts dedicating 12 hours of your day to physical training and 4 hours to trying to push your magical limits.
	You kept at it for 8 more years until something changed your life forever.

	<p>I am going to ask one time and one time only. Are you SURE you wish to go with this class/role?</p>
