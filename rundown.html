	<p>Okay, thank you for clicking the link to come to this page, now let me explain.</p>

As you have noticed, I have been talking to you as if I am standing next to you, I will continue doing that throughout the story.
Think of me as a Text-RPG version of the LoZ Ocarina of Time Navi that Link has follow him.
The next thing you need to know is that all stories from all races and classes cross paths at least once or twice.
The other thing is that you will have almost no options on what armor you wear, possibly two options at best right before we start our adventure.
There is absolutely no erotica of the obvious kind or whatever, no sex. That does not mean that I won't add little snip-bits of teases along the way.
Oh! And another thing, not only will I be talking to you (the reader), but I will also communicate with your character, I will help with influencing you to do some things while trying to get you to not do others and mostly annoy you.
